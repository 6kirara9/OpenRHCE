==================================
------------------------
Spring 2011
------------------------

=====================================================

.. include:: OpenRHCE_Instructor.rst.txt


Introductions: Fellow Students
=====================================================

Please Introduce Yourselves
----------------------------

* Name

* Where you work or what you do.

* What Linux experience do you already have?

* What goals do you have for this class?

* Something fun about yourself.



Introductions: The Course
=====================================================

Expectations
--------------

* Should I be able to pass the RHCE on this class alone?

Preparation Recommendations
----------------------------

* Practice/Study Environment

   - 2 or 3 systems or VMs, networked together

   - RHEL 5 (eval), CENTOS 5, or Fedora (Fedora Core 6 will be closest to RHEL 5)

   - Red Hat docs at http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/#RHEL5 

   - RHCE Prep Guide at https://www.redhat.com/certification/rhce/prep_guide/

   - Practice, practice, practice!




The Red Hat Certification Landscape
=========================================

* RHCSA

    RHCSA is new, replacing the RHCT.  It is the "core" sysadmin certification from Red Hat. To earn RHCE and other system administration certs will require first earning the RHCSA.

* RHCE

    RHCE is a senior system administration certification. It is an eligibility requirement for taking any COE exams and is thus a requirement for the upper-level credentials as well.
    

* Certificates of Expertise

    COEs are incremental credentials demonstrating skills and knowledge in specialized areas. They are worthy credentials in their own right, but also the building blocks of the upper level credentials.

* RHCSS, RHCDS, RHCA

    These upper level credentials recognize those who have achieved expertise in several related specialized areas.  Each one requires multiple COEs.


RHCSA: Understand & Use Essential Tools
===========================================

    * Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax
    * Use input-output redirection (>, >>, ``|``, 2>, etc.)
    * Use grep and regular expressions to analyze text
    * Access remote systems using ssh and VNC
    * Log in and switch users in multi-user runlevels
    * Archive, compress, unpack and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2

RHCSA: ...Essential Tools... (cont)
=========================================
    * Create and edit text files
    * Create, delete, copy and move files and directories
    * Create hard and soft links
    * List, set and change standard ugo/rwx permissions
    * Locate, read and use system documentation including man, info, and files in /usr/share/doc .

          [Note: Red Hat may use applications during the exam that are not included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for the purpose of evaluating candidate's abilities to meet this objective.]

Exam Objectives

RHCE exam candidates should consult the RHCSA Exam Objectives document and be capable of RHCSA-level tasks, as some of these skills may be required in order to meet RHCE exam objectives.
