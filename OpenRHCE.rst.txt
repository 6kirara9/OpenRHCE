Introductions: The Course
-------------------------------

Expectations
__________________

* Should I be able to pass the RHCE on this class alone?

    A stunning number of seasoned professionals taking Red Hat's own prep courses fail to pass on first attempt.

* Planning for more than one attempt is prudent.

* Maximizing your out-of-class preparation time is prudent.

Preparation Recommendations
_______________________________

* Practice/Study Environment

   * 2 or 3 systems or VMs, networked together.  Virtualized hosting providers may be an alternative.

   * RHEL 6 (eval), CENTOS 6 (when available), or Fedora (Fedora 13 will be closest to RHEL 6)

   * Red Hat docs at: 

        http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/index.html

   * RHCE Objectives and other information at:

        http://www.redhat.com/certification/

   * Practice, practice, practice!

Red Hat Enterprise Linux
-----------------------------

* Overview
* Server and Desktop variants
* Add-on Functionality
* LifeCycle



The Red Hat Certification Landscape
-----------------------------------------

* RHCSA

    RHCSA is new, replacing the RHCT.  It is the "core" sysadmin certification from Red Hat. To earn RHCE and other system administration certs will require first earning the RHCSA.

* RHCE

    RHCE is a senior system administration certification. It is an eligibility requirement for taking any COE exams and is thus a requirement for the upper-level credentials as well.
    

* Certificates of Expertise

    COEs are incremental credentials demonstrating skills and knowledge in specialized areas. They are worthy credentials in their own right, but also the building blocks of the upper level credentials.

* RHCSS, RHCDS, RHCA

    These upper level credentials recognize those who have achieved expertise in several related specialized areas.  Each one requires multiple COEs.

* Terminal commands: shutdown, halt, poweroff, reboot, init

Runlevels
--------------------------------

* Default
* From GRUB Menu

Single User Mode
---------------------------------------

* Password Recovery

Note:  SELinux bug prevents password changes while set to "Enforcing".

Log Files
------------------------------------

``/var/log/*``

View with ``cat``, ``less`` or other tools

Search with ``grep``

Start/Stop Virtual Machines
--------------------------------------------------

* Using virt-manager

* Using virsh commands



Virtual Machine Consoles
--------------------------------------------------

* virt-manager

* virt-viewer


Virtual Machine Text Console
------------------------------------------------------

With libguestfs-tools installed and the VM in question shut-down, from the host::

    # virt-edit {VMname} /boot/grub/menu.lst

There, append to the kernel line:: 

    console=tty0 console=ttyS0.

After saving, the following commands should allow a console based view of the boot process and a console login::

    # virsh start {VMname} ; virsh console {VMname} 

Virtual Machine Text Console Caveat
----------------------------------------

    After this change, some messages that appear only on the default console will be visible only here.  For example, the passphrase prompt to decrypt LUKS-encrypted partitions mounted in /etc/fstab will not be visible when using virt-viewer and the vm will appear to be hung.  Only by using virsh console can the passphrase be entered to allow the boot process to continue.


Start, stop, and check the status of network services
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Modify the system bootloader
-----------------------------------------------------


Session 2 Storage and filesystems
======================================

"Filesystem" - Disambiguation
------------------------------------

Several meanings for the term:



* The way files are physically written to storage devices, as in  the ext3, Fat-32, NTFS filesystems, or etc.

* The unified directory structure which logically organizes files

* The standard which defines how directories should be structured and utilized in Linux




Linux Filesystem Hierarchy
---------------------------------------------

The directory structure of a Linux system is standardized through the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (explained at http://www.pathname.com/fhs)

The Linux Manual system has an abbreviated reference:

``$ man 7 hier``

Red Hat has a more complete description, along with RedHat-specific implementation decisions in their **Deployment Guide** at http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5/html/Deployment_Guide/ch-filesystem.html

.. for future development, consider expanding this...

Disk and Filesystem tools
---------------------------------


* ``fdisk`` or ``parted`` -- Used to partition hard disks or other block devices


* ``mkfs`` and variants -- Used to create filesystems on block devices (actually a front-end for a variety of FS-specific tools)


* ``fsck`` and variants -- Used to run filesystem checks (a front-end to FS specific tools)


* ``mount`` -- Used to mount a filesystem to a specific location in the directory structure


* ``/etc/fstab`` -- Configuration file used to describe the filesystems that should be persistently mounted

* ``blkid`` -- used to identify filesystems or other in-use devices by UUID or filesystem labels.

* ``df`` -- used to display the capacity and utilization % of mounted filesystems.

* ``partx`` -- used to force implementation of a new partition table on an in-use device w/o the need to reboot.


Working with Partitions
-------------------------------------------

Overview of process for using Basic Storage Devices:

* Install the device or otherwise make it available to the system.
* Partition it with ``fdisk`` or ``parted``.
* Create a filesystem on the partition with mkfs or other tools.
* Choose or create a directory to serve as a mount point.
* Mount the partition.
* Add an entry to ``/etc/fstab`` to make it persistent.

.. List, create, delete and set partition type for primary, extended, and logical partitions

Working with Logical Volume Management
--------------------------------------------------------

Overview of process for using Logical Volume Management:

* Install the device or otherwise make it available to the system.
* Create a type ``8e`` partition with ``fdisk`` or ``parted``. 
* Initialize the partition as a physical volume with ``pvcreate``.
* Add the storage of the PV to a volume group with ``vgcreate``.
* Allocate storage from the volume group to a logical volume with ``lvcreate``.
* Create a filesystem on the logical volume with mkfs or other tools.
* Choose or create a directory to serve as a mount point.
* Mount the partition.
* Add an entry to ``/etc/fstab`` to make it persistent.


.. Create and remove physical volumes, assign physical volumes to volume groups, create and delete logical volumes


Removing Logical Volume structures
----------------------------------------

* Unmount the lv you want to remove
* Edit /etc/fstab to remove its entry
* Remove the logical volume: ``lvremove /dev/<vg>/<lv>``
* Before removing a VG, ensure there are no more LVs within it.
* Remove the volume group: ``vgremove /dev/<vg>``
* Remove the LVM signature from the partitions: ``pvremove /dev/<part>``


Commands to Know
---------------------------------------

fdisk

* Always use -u and -c for best compatibility with newer storage devices
* Can't create partitions >= 2TB, use parted with GPT instead

mkfs

* Used to create filesystems on devices
* Front-end for other filesystem-specific tools (usually named mkfs.<fstype>)

blkid

* Shows device name, Fileystem Labels, and UUID of detected block devices.
* May not show block devices until a filesystem is created on them.
* May not show block devices used in non-standard ways (for example, a filesystem on a whole disk instead of on a partition)

mount

* used to make a new filesystem available 


Working with LUKS encrypted storage
-----------------------------------------------------

cryptsetup-luks-1.1.2-2.el6.x86_64

Overview of process for using LUKS encryption:

* Create a new partition
* Encrypt it with ``cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/<partition>``
* Open the encrypted device and assign it a name with ``cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/<partition> <name>``
* Create a filesystem on the named device (/dev/mapper/<name>)
* Create a mountpoint for the device
* Mount the device

To lock the volume:

* unmount it
* Use ``cryptsetup luksClose <name>`` to remove the decryption mapping

Persistent mounting of LUKS devices
------------------------------------------------------

To persistently mount it

 * Create an entry in /etc/crypttab::

    <name> /dev/<partition> <password (none|<blank>|<path/to/file/with/password>)>

 * If the password field is "none" or left blank, the system will prompt for a password.

 * Create an entry in /etc/fstab

 .. note::

    At reboot, the password prompt goes only to the default console.  If console redirection is enabled, as it might be in the case of enabling a virtual machine to accessible through ``virsh console <name>``, then the only place where the prompt is seen and the passphrase can be entered is at that redirected console.

.. Create and configure LUKS-encrypted partitions and logical volumes to prompt for password and mount a decrypted file system at boot

Working with SWAP
--------------------------------------

Overview of process for adding SWAP space using a partition:

* Create a type 82 partition
* Initialize as swap with ``mkswap /dev/<partition>``
* Identify the UUID with ``blkid``
* Add an ``/etc/fstab`` line::

     UUID=<UUID> swap swap defaults 0 0

* Activate the new swap space with: ``swapon -a``

Using a file for SWAP 
-----------------------------------------

Overview of process for adding SWAP space using a file:

* create a pre-allocated file of the desired size::

    dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/<swapfile> bs=1M count=<size in MB>

* Initialize as swap with ``mkswap /path/to/<swapfile>``
* Add an ``/etc/fstab`` line:: 

    /path/to/<swapfile> swap swap defaults 0 0
    
* Activate the new swap space with: ``swapon -a``

Mounting Using UUIDs and Filesystem Labels
------------------------------------------------------

Configure systems to mount file systems at boot by Universally Unique ID (UUID) or label

Local Storage: Adding New Storage
-------------------------------------

Add new partitions, logical volumes, and swap to a system non-destructively

File systems: Working with Common Linux Filesystems
--------------------------------------------------------

Create, mount, unmount and use ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems

Extend existing unencrypted ext4-formatted logical volumes



Filesystem Permissions: Basic Permissions
--------------------------------------------------------


Linux permissions are organized around:


* Three sets of permissions -- User, Group, and Other


* Three types of permissions -- Read, Write, and Execute


* Three extended attributes -- SUID, SGID, and Stickybit





Three Sets of Permissions:
-------------------------------

Any given file or directory can be owned by one (and only one) user and one (and only one) group. Three different sets of permissions can be assigned.



* User -- User permissions apply to the individual user who owns the file or directory.

* Group -- Group permissions apply to any user who is a member of the group that owns the file or directory.

* Other -- Other permissions apply to any user account with access to the system that does not fall into the previous categories.




Three Types of Permissions:
---------------------------------

* Read ("r")

    * On a file, allows reading

    * On a directory, allows listing

* Write ("w")
        
    * On a file, allows editing

    * On a directory, allows creation and deletion of files

* Execute ("x")

    * On a file, allows execution if the file is otherwise executable (script or binary)

    * On a directory, allows entry or traversal (``# cd {dirname}``)





Three Extended Attributes:
---------------------------------



* SUID (Set User ID) 
        On an executable, runs a process under the UID of the file owner rather than that of the user executing it. 



* SGID (Set Group ID)
        On a directory, causes any files created in the directory to belong to the group owning the directory.



* "Stickybit"  
        On a directory, ensures that only the owner of a file or the owner of the directory can delete it, even if all users or other members of a group have write access to the directory.




Viewing Permissions 
----------------------------

Permissions are displayed with positions 2-10 of a "long" filelisting:

    .. image:: images/permblock.gif
        :width: 40%




Setting Permissions
-----------------------

The ``chmod`` command is used to set permissions on both files and directories.  It has two modes -- one using symbolic options and one using octal numbers.



``chmod [option] [ugoa...][+-=][rwxst] filename``
    where ugo are user, group, other, or all and rwxst are read, write, execute, s{u/g}id, stickybit.



``chmod [option] XXXX filename``
    where XXXX is a number representing the complete permissions on the file.



Setting Permissions with Numeric Options
-------------------------------------------------



+--------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|              | User      |  Group    | Other     |
+==============+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
|Permissions   | r | w | x | r | w | x | r | w | x |
+--------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|Numeric Value | 4 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
+--------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|Sum           |   0-7     |    0-7    |    0-7    |
+--------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+



+--------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| example.txt  | User      |  Group    | Other     |
+==============+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
|Permissions   | r | w | x | r |\- | x |\- |\- | x |
+--------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|Numeric Value | 4 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
+--------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|Sum           |     7     |    5      |     1     |
+--------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+



``# chmod 751 myfile.txt``


Setting Extended Attributes with Numeric Options
--------------------------------------------------



chmod numeric options are actually 4 digits (not three).  Missing digits are assumed to be leading zeroes. 



The leftmost place is for extended attributes:




+-----------+-------+-------+-----------+
| Attribute | SUID  | SGID  | Stickybit |
+===========+=======+=======+===========+
| Value     | 4     | 2     | 1         |
+-----------+-------+-------+-----------+



**Example:** ``$ chmod 3775 MySharedDir``



Setting Extended Attributes with Symbolic Values:
--------------------------------------------------------

``chmod +t {filename}``
        Sets the sticky bit

``chmod u+s {filename}``
        Sets suid

``chmod g+s {filename}`` 
        Sets sgid


Extended Attributes in Directory Listings
--------------------------------------------------

===========  ==================================================
\-rwxrwxrwx   Normal Permissions, All permissions granted  
\-rwSrwxrwx   Indicates SUID set
\-rwsrwxrwx   Indicates SUID and execute permission set
\-rwxrwSrwx   Indicates SGID set
\-rwxrwsrwx   Indicates SGID and execute permission set
\-rwxrwxrwT   Indicates Stickybit set
\-rwxrwxrwt   Indicates Stickybit and execute permission set
===========  ==================================================
   


Umask
--------------

* The umask value determines the permissions that will be applied to newly created files and directories.

* As a "mask" it is subtractive -- representing the value of the permissions you DO NOT want to grant.

* Execute rights are automatically withheld (w/o regard for the umask) for *files* but not for *directories*.

* Extended attributes are not addressed -- even though a umask is four characters.

* The default umask value is set in /etc/bashrc and can be modified (non-persistently!) with the bash built-in command ``umask``.




Umask Examples
--------------------------

* Umask of 0002 yields permissions of 0775 on new directories and 0664 on new files
        
* Umask of 0022 yields permissions of 0755 on new directories and 0644 on new files



SGID and Stickybit Use Case -- Collaborative Directories
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* Create a Group for Collaboration
* Add users to the group
* Create a directory for collaboration
* Set its group ownership to the intended group
* Set its group permissions appropriately
* Recursively set the SGID and sticky bits on the directory

This ensures that:

    #. All files created in this directory will be owned by the intended group (SGID effect)

    #. All files created in this directory can only be deleted by the user who owns the file or the user who owns the directory (stickybit effect)
    

File Access Control Lists
--------------------------------------------------------


* Provide more granular control of permissions.

* Filesystem must be mounted with the 'acl' option or be compiled with that option by default

getfacl

setfacl



getfacl
------------------

Example of "getfacl acldir"
::

  # file: acldir
  # owner: frank
  # group: frank
  user::rwx
  user:bob:-wx
  user:mary:rw-
  group::rwx
  mask::rwx
  other::r-x

Example of ``ls -l acldir``::

  drwxrwxr-x+ 2 frank frank 4096 2009-05-27 14:15 acldir


.. Create and manage File Access Control Lists


Working with CIFS network file systems
----------------------------------------------------------------

Will be covered in more detail later.



Mount and unmount CIFS network file systems

Working with NFS file systems
--------------------------------------------------

Mount and unmount NFS file systems


iSCSI Devices
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: iscsi-initiator-utils

Allows a system to access remote storage devices with SCSI commands as though it were a local hard disk.

Terms:

* iSCSI initiator: A client requesting access to storage
* iSCSI target: Remote storage device presented from an iSCSI server or "target portal"
* iSCSI target portal: A server providing targets to the initiator
* IQN: "iSCSI Qualified Name" -- a unique name.  Both the initiator and target need such a name to be assigned


Accessing iSCSI Devices
------------------------------------------------

* Install the iscsi-initiator-utils package
* Start the ``iscsi`` and ``iscsid`` services (and configure them persistently on)
* Set the initiator IQN in /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi
* Discover targets with::

    iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p <portal IP address>

* Log in to the target using the name displayed in discovery::

    iscsiadm -m mode -T <IQN> -p <portal IP address> -l

* Identify the SCSI device name with ``dmesg``, ``tail /var/log/messages`` or ``ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/*iscsi*``

* Use the disk as though it were a local hard disk

.. important::

    Be certain to use UUIDs or labels for persistent mounts in ``/etc/fstab``.  Also, provide ``_netdev`` as a mount option so that this device will not be mounted until the network is already up.
.. Configure a system as an iSCSI initiator that persistently mounts an iSCSI target

Disconnecting from iSCSI Devices
------------------------------------------------------

* Ensure the device is not in use
* Unmount the device
* Remove its ``/etc/fstab`` entry
* Logout from the target::

Session 3 Managing software, processes, kernel attributes, and users and groups
==================================================================================

The Red Hat Network (RHN)
--------------------------

The primary delivery mechanism for installable software, updates, errata and bug fixes and systems management functions for an installation of RHEL 6 is the Red Hat Network or RHN.

The "cost" of RHEL 6 is really a subscription to this support network.

These commands are using in managing an RHN subscription::

    # man -k rhn
    rhn-profile-sync     (8)  - Update system information on Red Hat Network
    rhn_check            (8)  - Check for and execute queued actions on RHN
    rhn_register         (8)  - Connect to Red Hat Network
    rhnplugin            (8)  - Red Hat Network support for yum(8)
    rhnplugin.conf [rhnplugin] (5)  - Configuration file for the rhnplugin(8) yum(8) plugin
    rhnreg_ks            (8)  - A program for non interactively registering systems to Red Hat Network
    rhnsd                (8)  - A program for querying the Red Hat Network for updates and information

RHN Subscription Activation
-----------------------------------------------------

A new user of RHEL6 should receive information similar to this::

     
    Red Hat subscription login:
        Account Number       : *******
        Contract Number      : *******
        Item Description     : Red Hat Enterprise Linux <Edition>
        RHEL Subscription Number : *******************
        Quantity             : #
        Service Dates        : 12-JUN-10 through 11-JUN-11
        Customer Name : *********************************
        Account Number: ************
        Log into the new portal here: access.redhat.com
        Login: *************
        Password: **************
        Email address: ****************************

That information can then be used with ``rhn_register`` to activate a new subscription

3rd Party Yum Repositories
----------------------------------

These are other repositories of installable software, updates, or bugfixes.  The ``yum`` command can be configured to use them in addition to or instead of the RHN.

* Configuration of repositories other than the RHN is accomplished through text configuration files located in the directory: ``/etc/yum.repos.d/``

* A configuration file for each repository (or group of related repos) should be created in ``/etc/yum.repos.d/`` 

* The name of each repo config file should end in ".repo".

* This allows repos to be easily temporarily disabled simply by renaming the file to something like: ``myrepo.repo.disabled``

Yum Repository Mandatory Configuration Items
----------------------------------------------

Repository ID
    Short name for identifying this repository in reports

    ::

        [MyRepo]

Name

    ::

        name=My Custom Repository

Baseurl
    Description of protocol and location needed to locate the repo files.

Yum Repository Common Optional Configuration Items
-----------------------------------------------------

gpgcheck
    Defines whether yum should attempt to validate package signatures. "0" = "off", "1" = "on".

    ::

        gpgcheck=1

gpgkey
    Defines (via URL) where the keys for signature validation are located (typically ``file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/<key name>``)

    ::

        gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

enabled
    (Optional) Defines whether this repository should be currently active. "0" = "off", "1" = "on".

RPM Architecture
----------------------

``rpm`` executable

RPM packages -- Files to install + SPEC file (metadata)

Local RPM database -- retains metadata from all installed packages

	Database is kept in /var/lib/rpm
	

	
RPM Package Naming
-------------------------

* name-version-release.architecture*.rpm

* Version is the version of the "upstream" open source code
	
* Release refers to Red Hat internal patches to the source code
	
* Architecture is one of:
	
	* i386,i686 -- 32 bit x86 compatible
	* x86_64 -- Intel/AMD 64 bit 
	* ppc64 -- Power PC 64 bit
	* ia64 -- Intel Itanium 64 bit
	* noarch -- Arch-independent code (scripts, docs, images, etc)
	* src -- Source code



Package Naming Example
----------------------------

bash-3.2-24.el5.x86_64.rpm

======      =================   ============     ========
 Name        Project Version     RH Release       Arch
======      =================   ============     ========
 bash        3.2                 24.el5           x86_64
======      =================   ============     ========

This package starts with version 3.2 of bash (from ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash), applies a RH patch identified as 24.el5 to it, and is then built to run on an Intel/AMD 64 bit processor.




Installing and Upgrading Packages
-----------------------------------

``# rpm -i[v,h] name-ver-rel.arch.rpm``
	Installs a package 
	
``# rpm -U[v,h] name-ver-rel.arch.rpm``
	Upgrades a package if an older version was previously installed. Otherwise, simply installs the new version.
	
``# rpm -F[v,h] name-ver-rel.arch.rpm``
	Upgrades a package if an older version is installed.  Otherwise, does nothing -- **does not install new packages if no older version was installed.**
	
	
Upgrading a Kernel
---------------------------

* Always use ``#rpm -i ...``

* This leaves the previously installed kernel on the system and in the GRUB menu as a fall-back in case the new version has problems.	


RPM and Modified Config Files
------------------------------------

Scenario: niftyapp-1.0-1.el5.rpm uses a config file, ``/etc/nifty.conf``. You tweaked ``/etc/nifty.conf`` to fit your system.  Now niftyapp-2.0-1.el5.rpm is available with new features that require changes in the .conf file and provides a new default config file.  What to do?

* If the previous version provided a default config file, the changes are detected.  Your modified version of the .conf file is saved as ``/etc/nifty.conf.rpmsave`` and the new default config is installed.  You can compare the files and modify as needed.

* If the previous version did NOT provide a default config file, your version of the .conf file is saved as ``/etc/nifty.conf.rpmorig`` and the new default config is installed.  You can compare the files and modify as needed.




Uninstalling
--------------------------

``# rpm -e name[-ver][-rel]``

* Package removal is never verbose, never shows progress ( -v, -h have not effect)

* Package removal only needs the name (or when multiple versions of the same package are installed, sometimes the version or release) but not the architecture or the .rpm extension.


RPM over a Network
------------------------

``# rpm -ivh ftp://{IP or Hostname}/path/to/packagename-ver-rel.arch.rpm``

``# rpm -ivh http://{IP or Hostname}/path/to/packagename-ver-rel.arch.rpm``

* And wildcard "globbing" is allowed:
	
	``# rpm -ivh http://{IP or Hostname}/path/to/packagename*``
	

Common RPM Queries
--------------------------

=========================           ==============================================================
Query                                  Result
=========================           ==============================================================
rpm -qa                                lists all installed packages.
rpm -q pkg                             Reports the version of the package.
rpm -qf /path/file                     Reports which package provided the file.
rpm -qc pkg                            Lists all configuration files of the package.
rpm -qd pkg                            Lists all documentation of the package.
rpm -qi pkg                            Reports a description of the package.
rpm -ql pkg                            Lists all files contained in the package.
rpm -qR pkg                            Lists all dependencies.
=========================           ==============================================================

rpm -q{c|d|i|l|R}p /path/to/packagename-ver-rel-arch.rpm
	Reports the same info as above, but pulls info from the .rpm file instead of the rpm database.


RPM Verification
-----------------------

The RPM system satisfies two types of security concerns:

#. Is this package *authentic*?  How do I know it came from Red Hat?

#. Has this package retained *integrity*? How do I know they haven't been modified?

Authenticity and integrity of packages can be confirmed prior to installation with GPG signing and MD5 checksums of the RPM packages.

Integrity of files can be confirmed after installation with verification of installed files against the recorded metadata in the package.


Validate Package Signatures
------------------------------------

1. Import the Red Hat GPG public key (It can be found on the installation CD or in the /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ directory)::
	
	# rpm --import /media/disk/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
	
or::
	
	# rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
	
2. Check the signature of the package in question::

	# rpm --checksig /path/to/package-ver-rel.arch.rpm
	


RPM Checksig Sample Output 
-----------------------------


``$ rpm --checksig ftp://linuxlib.us.dell.com/``
``pub/Distros/RedHat/RHEL5/5.3/Server/x86_64/``
``install-x86_64/Server/ImageMagick-6.2.8.0-4``
``.el5_1.1.i386.rpm``

``ftp://linuxlib.us.dell.com/pub/Distros/RedHat``
``/RHEL5/5.3/Server/x86_64/install-x86_64/Server``
``/ImageMagick-6.2.8.0-4.el5_1.1.i386.rpm: (sha1)``
``dsa sha1 md5 gpg OK``


Verify Installed Files
--------------------------

``rpm -V`` (or ``--verify``) will compare existing files on the system to their pristine state in the packages they came from.

There are 8 points of comparison as shown in the following table, in the Michael Jang book and in the rpm man page:





Change Codes from rpm --verify
---------------------------------------


============ =====================

Identifying Installed Packages
--------------------------------------

View a list of the packages originally installed on the system::

	# less /root/install.log
	
View a list of the packages installed on the system (list typically updated once per day)::
	
	# less /var/log/rpmpkgs
	
Query the RPM database for the packages installed right now::

	# rpm -qa 






Managing Software:  Building RPMs
-------------------------------------


As of this writing, Red Hat is pointing users to the following RPM Guide from the Fedora project for more information on RPM creation: 
http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora_Draft_Documentation/0.1/html/RPM_Guide/

Inside an RPM package
-------------------------

* files
* scripts
* metadata

Good example of a spec file can be obtained from the source rpm for redhat-release.

Open .spec in vim for color highlighting

Main sections:
%prep
%build
%install
%clean

Useful entries:
BuildRequires:
BuildArch:

Packages to install
-------------------------

rpm-build
rpmdevtools
rpmlint

Setting up a Build Environment
----------------------------------

As a non-privileged user, run:

$ rpmdev-setuptree

This should create the following directory structure in your home directory:
 ~/rpmbuild
├── BUILD
├── RPMS
├── SOURCES
├── SPECS
└── SRPMS

In that structure, your source files (in a tarball) should be placed ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/ and your .spec file in ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/. The ~/rpmbuild/BUILD/ directory will be a temporary working directory for the build process. And, after the rpmbuild process is complete, the finished binary and source RPMs will be placed in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/ and ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/, respectively.

Viewing the Build Environment
-----------------------------------

When diagnosing build problems, it is sometimes useful to see what files are actually being created in the build environment in order to identify deviations of actual behavior from expected behavior. The tree utility is useful for that.

Install tree with # yum install tree.

Invoke tree with $ tree ~/rpmbuild to show the contents of the build environment.

Signing Your RPMs
-----------------------


Your RPMs can be digitally signed to protect users from the possibility of forged packages (any RPM package can execute scripts w/ root privileges when installed!). To implement this, first generate and identify a gpg key:

$ gpg --gen-key
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.14; Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 
Requested keysize is 2048 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Scott Purcell
Email address: scott@texastwister.info
Comment: 
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Scott Purcell <scott@texastwister.info>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

Configure rpm-related tools to use your signature:

$ echo '%_gpg_name Scott Purcell'>> ~/.rpmmacros 

or

$ echo '%_gpg_name B9AED1DE'>> ~/.rpmmacros 

Now packages can be created and signed at the same time with rpmbuild using the --sign option. Or existing packages can be retroactively signed with rpm using the --addsign or --resign options.

With a signed package in place, the user intending to install it now needs to import the key:

# rpm --import /home/scott/RPM-GPG-KEY-ScottPurcell

And with the key imported, the package can be verified:
$ rpm -K rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/rhel6rhce-0.5-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/rhel6rhce-0.5-1.el6.x86_64.rpm: rsa sha1 (md5) pgp md5 OK


Exercise
----------------

As root, install rpm-build, rpmlint, rpmdevtools

# yum -y install rpmbuild rpmdevtools rpmlint

As a non-privileged user:

Create a project directory
$ mkdir ~/hello-1.0

Name this according to the convention: <projname>-<majorver>.<minorver>

Create bash script: ~/hello-1.0/hello.sh
#!/bin/bash
# hello.sh
echo 'hello'
exit 0

Create a tarball of the project directory
$ tar cvzf hello-1.0.tar.gz ~/hello-1.0/



Create an rpm development environment
$ rpmdev-setuptree


Move the tarball to the SOURCES directory

Create a .spec file in the SPECS directory

$ vim pkgname.spec

or

$ rpmdev-newspec -o pkgname.spec

Insert a name (Match the pkgname on the tarball and direcotory)
Insert a version (Match the version)
Leave the release alone
Insert a summary (one line)
Insert a group (package group)
Insert a license
Insert a URL or delete the line
Insert on the Source0 line, the name of your tarball
Leave the BuildRoot line alone
Unless your package has prerequisites needed before it can be compiled, delete the BuildRequires line
Unless your package has prerequisites needed before it can work, delete the Requires line
On a blank line below %description, insert a brief description of your package
Leave the %prep and %setup lines alone
If your package does not need to be "built" (compiled), delete the %build, %configure, and make lines.
Leave the %install section header alone. 
Under the %install section, leave the rm line alone. 
If your package does not need to be built, modify the make install line to something like this:
install -D myfile $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/path/to/install/dest/myfile
Leave the %clean and the rm -rf lines alone.
Under %files, use the following syntax to list each of the files your package will place on the target system:
%attr(770,owner,group)/path/to/file
Use the following syntax to list each of the directories you package will place on the target system:
%dir /root/bin
The changelog section can be deleted or left alone.
