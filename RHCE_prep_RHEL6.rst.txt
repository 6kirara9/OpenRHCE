Introductions: The Course
-------------------------------

Expectations
__________________

* Should I be able to pass the RHCE on this class alone?

    A stunning number of seasoned professionals taking Red Hat's own prep courses fail to pass on first attempt.

* Planning for more than one attempt is prudent.

* Maximizing your out-of-class preparation time is prudent.

Preparation Recommendations
_______________________________

* Practice/Study Environment

   * 2 or 3 systems or VMs, networked together.  Virtualized hosting providers may be an alternative.

   * RHEL 6 (eval), CENTOS 6 (when available), or Fedora (Fedora 13 will be closest to RHEL 6)

   * Red Hat docs at: 

        http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/index.html

   * RHCE Objectives and other information at:

        http://www.redhat.com/certification/

   * Take initiative -- form a study group.

   * Practice, practice, practice!

The Red Hat Certification Landscape
-----------------------------------------

* RHCSA

    RHCSA is new, replacing the RHCT.  It is the "core" sysadmin certification from Red Hat. To earn RHCE and other system administration certs will require first earning the RHCSA.

* RHCE

    RHCE is a senior system administration certification. It is an eligibility requirement for taking any COE exams and is thus a requirement for the upper-level credentials as well.
    

* Certificates of Expertise

    COEs are incremental credentials demonstrating skills and knowledge in specialized areas. They are worthy credentials in their own right, but also the building blocks of the upper level credentials.

* RHCSS, RHCDS, RHCA

    These upper level credentials recognize those who have achieved expertise in several related specialized areas.  Each one requires multiple COEs.
