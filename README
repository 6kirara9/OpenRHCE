An effort to collaboratively prepare study materials to help candidates achieve Red Hat's RHCE certification.  Please note that this effort will be based ONLY on Red Hat's posted objectives and NOT on any insider knowledge of the actual contents of the exam.  This is not an effort to provide "brain-dumps" but to provide a recommended course of meaningful preparation.
