Introductions: The Course
-------------------------------

Expectations
__________________

* Should I be able to pass the RHCE on this class alone?

    A stunning number of seasoned professionals taking Red Hat's own prep courses fail to pass on first attempt.

* Planning for more than one attempt is prudent.

* Maximizing your out-of-class preparation time is prudent.

Preparation Recommendations
_______________________________

* Practice/Study Environment

   * 2 or 3 systems or VMs, networked together.  Virtualized hosting providers may be an alternative.

   * RHEL 6 (eval), CENTOS 6 (when available), or Fedora (Fedora 13 will be closest to RHEL 6)

   * Red Hat docs at: 

        http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/index.html

   * RHCE Objectives and other information at:

        http://www.redhat.com/certification/

   * Take initiative -- form a study group.

   * Practice, practice, practice!

Red Hat Enterprise Linux
-----------------------------

* Overview
* Server and Desktop variants
* Add-on Functionality
* LifeCycle



The Red Hat Certification Landscape
-----------------------------------------

* RHCSA

    RHCSA is new, replacing the RHCT.  It is the "core" sysadmin certification from Red Hat. To earn RHCE and other system administration certs will require first earning the RHCSA.

* RHCE

    RHCE is a senior system administration certification. It is an eligibility requirement for taking any COE exams and is thus a requirement for the upper-level credentials as well.
    

* Certificates of Expertise

    COEs are incremental credentials demonstrating skills and knowledge in specialized areas. They are worthy credentials in their own right, but also the building blocks of the upper level credentials.

* RHCSS, RHCDS, RHCA

    These upper level credentials recognize those who have achieved expertise in several related specialized areas.  Each one requires multiple COEs.

Boot, Reboot, Shutdown
---------------------------------------------

* GRUB Menu
* Display Manager Screen
* Gnome or KDE
* Terminal commands: shutdown, halt, poweroff, reboot, init

Runlevels
--------------------------------

* Default
* From GRUB Menu

Single User Mode
---------------------------------------

* Password Recovery

Note:  SELinux bug prevents password changes while set to "Enforcing".

Log Files
------------------------------------

``/var/log/*``

View with ``cat``, ``less`` or other tools

Search with ``grep``

Start/Stop Virtual Machines
--------------------------------------------------

* Using virt-manager

* Using virsh commands



Virtual Machine Consoles
--------------------------------------------------

* virt-manager

* virt-viewer


Virtual Machine Text Console
------------------------------------------------------

With libguestfs-tools installed and the VM in question shut-down, from the host::

    # virt-edit {VMname} /boot/grub/menu.lst

There, append to the kernel line:: 

    console=tty0 console=ttyS0.

After saving, the following commands should allow a console based view of the boot process and a console login::

    # virsh start {VMname} ; virsh console {VMname} 

Virtual Machine Text Console Caveat
----------------------------------------

    After this change, some messages that appear only on the default console will be visible only here.  For example, the passphrase prompt to decrypt LUKS-encrypted partitions mounted in /etc/fstab will not be visible when using virt-viewer and the vm will appear to be hung.  Only by using virsh console can the passphrase be entered to allow the boot process to continue.


Start, stop, and check the status of network services
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Modify the system bootloader
