RHCE Practice Exam #01
==============================

These tasks are taken from the objectives Red Hat has publicly posted and should therefore approximate the type of tasks one might find on the RHCE exam.  It is expressly NOT based on actual contents of a Red Hat Exam.

You should configure your physical server and three virtual machines as follows:

.. csv-table:: Systems Configuration
    :header: "", "Physical Host", "vm1", "vm2", "vm3"
    :widths: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

    "Hostname", "s<x>host.linux-acc.local" , "s<x>server.linux-acc.local" , "s<x>client.linux-acc.local" , "s<x>untrusted.linux-acc.local"
    "IP Address", "192.168.5.<x>0", "192.168.5.<x>1", "192.168.5.<x>2", "DHCP"
    "Subnet", "/22 or 255.255.252.0", "/22 or 255.255.252.0", "/22 or 255.255.252.0", "n/a"
    "Def. GW", "192.168.4.1", "192.168.4.1", "192.168.4.1", "192.168.4.1"

Networks:

    Local network
        192.168.4.0/22 (255.255.252.0), GW 192.168.4.0, DNS 192.168.7.254

    Trusted subnet
        192.168.5.0/24 (255.255.255.0)

    Untrusted subnet
        192.168.4.0/24 (255.255.255.0)
        
Configuration Common to all three VMs
=========================================

Obtain the .repo file from ftp://192.168.5.200 and install it in the appropriate location for yum configuration.  Or configure a repo using a source URL of:


Untrusted VM Configuration
================================

On the untrusted host, use DHCP networking and install/configure only that components that are required for testing prohibited access to the services described below.

Configuration Common to both the Server and Client VMs
============================================================

* Create Users:
    * ford (UID=1005)
    * carter (UID=1006)
    * reagan (UID=1007)
    * clinton (UID=1008)


* Create Groups:

    * presidents (GID=1000; members=ford, carter, reagan, clinton)
    * republicans (GID=1001; members=ford, reagan)
    * democrats (GID=1002; members=carter, clinton)

Server Configuration
========================


* SSH connections should be allowed from throughout the 192.168.4.0/22 network.
* For all other services, connections should be allowed from addresses within the trusted network (192.168.5.0/24), but disallowed from 192.168.4.0/24.
* Configure an SMTP server that allows connections from the trusted subnet.
* Connect to the iSCSI target provided by the target portal at 192.168.5.200.
* Partition the iSCSI disk
* Configure this virtual machine to boot to a command-line only.

* Add add'l swap space

* Create a PV, VG, and LV

* Create directories:

    ``/share/presidents``
    
        * All four users must be able to write here. 
        * This directory must be owned by root and the group presidents.
        * Only users in this group should have any access to the directory.
        * Files created here should be owned by the group presidents.
        * Users should not be able to delete files they did not create.
        * This directory should have an SELinux fcontext that will permit it to be shared by multiple services.
        
    
    ``/share/presidents/republicans``

        * This directory should be owned by root and the group republicans.
        * Files created here should be owned by the group republicans.
        * Only users in this group should have any access to the directory.
        * Users should not be able to delete files they did not create.
        * This directory should have an SELinux fcontext that will permit it to be shared by multiple services.

    ``/share/presidents/democrats``

        * This directory should be owned by root and the group democrats.
        * Files created here should be owned by the group democrats.
        * Only users in this group should have any access to the directory.
        * Users should not be able to delete files they did not create.
        * This directory should have an SELinux fcontext that will permit it to be shared by multiple services.

* Configure each of these four directories to be shared via NFS to any system in the trusted subnet.  Ensure that root privileges cannot be gained from a remote mount.

* Configure an FTP server to allow anonymous downloads from ``/var/ftp/pub`` and anonymous uploads to ``/var/ftp/pub/inbound`` (create this directory and set permissions appropriately). Ensure that uploaded files cannot be viewed or downloaded without admin intervention.

* Configure a Web server to serve the following vhosts:

    Access to pres.s<x>server.linux-acc.local
        serves an index page located in /share/presidents/
        
    Access to rep.s<x>server.linux-acc.local
        serves an index page located in /share/presidents/republicans/

    Access to dem.s<x>server.linux-acc.local
        serves an index page located in /share/presidents/democrats/    

    Use filesystem ACLs to resolve any permissions issues you encounter.

    Place and index file in each of these locations that indicates which directory it is in and under which name it should be served out.


* Configure Samba to share the /share/presidents directory using a share name of presidents. Make it readable for ford and carter and writable for reagan and clinton. 


* SELinux should run in Enforcing mode and not interfering with any desired services.

* The firewall should be enabled and not interfering with any desired services.



Client Configuration
=========================

Mount an NFS share from the server

Mount a SAMBA share from the server

Configure this virtual machine to boot to the Gnome GUI.

* Create a directory ``/home/remote``.

* Configure the automounter such that attempt to access locations in ``/home/remote/presidents/`` cause the nfs share ``/share/presidents`` from your server to be mounted at ``/home/remote/presidents``.

* Configure static name resolution so that s<x>server.linux-acc.local, s<x>server, pres.s<x>server.linux-acc.local, rep.s<x>server.linux-acc.local, and dem.s<x>server.linux-acc.local all resolve to the ip address of your server VM.
